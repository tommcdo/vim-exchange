INTRODUCTION                                    *exchange*

This plugin provides |operators| for exchanging text in two places. The main
operator is |cx|, which is used in pairs. Each time it is used, it defines a
region of text to be exchanged; on the second use, the two defined regions are
exchanged. If one region is fully contained within the other, it replaces the
containing region.

MAPPINGS                                        *exchange-mappings*

                                                *cx* *exchange-define*
cx{motion}              Used in pairs.
                        FIRST USE: define the first region of text to be
                        exchanged. Any valid {motion} can be used.
                        SECOND USE: define the second region of text and
                        perform the exchange.
                        Note: If a region was defined accidentally, it can
                        be cleared with |cxc|

                                                *cxx* *exchange-define-line*
cxx                     Like |cx|, but for the current line. |linewise|

                                                *cxc* *exchange-clear*
cxc                     Clear any defined region of text (previously defined
                        by a |cx| command)

                                                *v_X* *exchange-visual*
{Visual}X               Can be used in |visual-mode|.

EXAMPLES                                        *exchange-examples*

In the text below, we will exchange everything inside the parentheses with
everything inside the double quotes.

First, place your cursor somewhere inside the quoted string and type `cxi"`.
Then move your cursor to somewhere inside the parentheses and type `cxi)`. The
text will the be changed to:

    Tom "The Dev" McDonald (a Vim plugin developer)

It should be noted that I don't actually go by that nickname.

SETTINGS                                        *exchange-settings*

To change the default mappings, simply provide your own mappings to the
commands below. The default mappings are as follows:

    nmap cx <Plug>(Exchange)
    xmap X <Plug>(Exchange)
    nmap cxc <Plug>(ExchangeClear)
    nmap cxx <Plug>(ExchangeLine)

For example, to change the mapping for exchanging a line, use the following:

    nmap cX <Plug>(ExchangeLine)

This will use the mapping `cX`, and the default `cxx` will not be mapped.

                                                *g:exchange_no_mappings*
g:exchange_no_mappings ~

If this variable is defined, the default mappings will not be created.
