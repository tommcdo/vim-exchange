INTRODUCTION                                    *exchange*

This plugin provides |operators| for exchanging text in two places. The main
operator is |cx|, which is used in pairs. Each time it is used, it defines
a region of text to to be exchanged; on the second use, the two defined regions
are exchanged.

MAPPINGS                                        *exchange-mappings*

                                                *cx* *exchange-define*
cx{motion}              Used in pairs.
                        FIRST USE: define the first region of text to be
                        exchanged. Any valid {motion} can be used.
                        SECOND USE: define the second region of text and
                        perform the exchange.
                        Note: If a region was defined accidentally, it can
                        be cleared with |cxc|

                                                *cxx* *exchange-define-line*
cxx                     Like |cx|, but for the current line. |linewise|

                                                *cxc* *exchange-clear*
cxc                     Clear any defined region of text (previously defined
                        by a |cx| command)

EXAMPLES                                        *exchange-examples*

In the text below, we will exchange everything inside the parentheses with
everything inside the double quotes.

First, place your cursor somewhere inside the quoted string and type `cxi"`.
Then move your cursor to somewhere inside the parentheses and type `cxi)`. The
text will the be changed to:

It should be noted that I don't actually go by that nickname.

SETTINGS                                        *exchange-settings*

*g:exchange_no_mappings*
    If this variable is defined, the default keyboard mappings will not be
    loaded. You are then free to define your own.
    The default mappings are
        nmap cx <Plug>Exchange
        vmap cx <Plug>Exchange
        nmap cxc <Plug>ExchangeClear
        nmap cxx <Plug>ExchangeLine
